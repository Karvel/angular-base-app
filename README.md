This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3 and has been updated to version 12.1.0.

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### CI

This project is configured to run Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions. The CI builds the application, runs tests, and runs the linter. All of these jobs need to pass for the CI build to succeed. The config file is found [here](./.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml).

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
